## Introduction to Git

### What is Git and why should I use it?

Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Git can automatically merge the changes, so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without losing each otherâ€™s work.

## Installation & Setup

### Installation

Git has been pre-installed in your ATD Lab environment. If you need to install Git on another system, instructions are provided at the links below.

Download Git - [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Configuration - [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Setup

When setting up Git for the first time you need to configure your Identity with a name and email address. This is used to add your signature to commits.

``` bash
# Set your username:
git config --global user.name "FirstName LastName"
# Set your email address:
git config --global user.email "name@example.com"
```

Verify your configuration:

``` bash
git config --global --list
```

## The Basics of Git

### My First Git Commands - Init and Status

#### Initialize Repository

The first thing you need to do to create a version controlled repository is to create a directory and initialize it. Initialize the following directory: `/home/user/git_projects/project1/`.

``` bash
# From a Linux terminal
mkdir /home/user/git_projects/project1/

# Change to the new directory
cd /home/user/git_projects/project1/

# Initialize
git init
```

The directory is now initialized as a Git repository and the following hidden directory `/home/user/git_projects/project1/.git/` was created. This is a special version control directory of the files in your repository.

#### Git Repository Status

``` bash
git status
```

If nothing has been modified, then you will see the following output.

``` text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

If you modify a the contents of existing files or add/delete files from the repository, you will see something like:

``` text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        newfile.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

### Stage Changes

When you wish to update the repository files, you will need to stage the files. The above output gives you a clue as to the command needed to stage the changes. You can specify individual files or specify all files with a period `.`

To stage all file changes:

``` bash
git add .
```

Then check the status again to see what is staged and ready to be committed.

``` bash
git status
```

Output:

``` text
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   README.md
        new file:   newfile.txt
```

Now we have 2 files staged and ready to be committed to the `main` branch.

### Commit Stages

Now you can commit your staged changes with a comment:

???+ note

    Use a comment that will reflect the changes made so you can reference back to this commit in the future.

``` bash
git commit -m "Initial Commit Message"
```

Output:

``` text
[main 71765fe] Initial commit
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 newfile.txt
```

Now these files are committed to your local copy of the repository. To update the remote repository in GitHub you need to push the changes.

## Intermediate Level

### Fork a Repository

A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with a pull request.

We have created an example repository for this workshop that you can fork to make your own copy. We will make changes to this copy of the original repository.

#### Steps to Fork the example repository

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to [https://github.com/PacketAnglers/avd-workshop](https://github.com/PacketAnglers/avd-workshop) repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
![Fork](assets/images/git_fork.png){: style="width:800px"}
3. Select an owner for the forked repository.
4. Set repository name. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repository.
5. Optionally, add a description of your fork.
6. Click the Fork button at the bottom

Next up... Clone this forked repository to your local host machine.

### Clone Repository

Cloning a repository allows us to make a local copy of a project that resides on GitHub. In the previous step, you forked a repo to your local GitHub account. Navigate to the forked repository in GitHub. From there, click on the green code button to get the URL of the forked repository.

![Git Clone](assets/images/git_clone.png){: style="width:400px"}

Clone this repository into the current directory of your local machine:

``` bash
# replace with the URL from your forked repo
git clone https://github.com/xxxxxxx/avd-workshop.git
```

Now change into the new cloned directory.

``` bash
cd avd-workshop
```

Verifyy where the remote copy of this clones lives.

``` bash
git remote -v
```

### Creating a Branch

A branch in Git is pointer to one of your commits. The default branch name in Git is `main`. As you make commits, the pointer moves to the latest commit on the current branch. Every time you commit, the branch pointer moves forward automatically.

Git branches are used to develop new features, without affecting the `main` branch. For example, if I wanted to play around with a new feature for my project, I might create a new branch called, `new-feature`.

![Branch](assets/images/git_branch.png)

You can see the current branch by typing:

``` bash
git branch
```

To create a new branch from the current branch pointer, type:

``` bash
git branch new-feature
```

To checkout or switch to this new branch, type:

``` bash
git checkout new-feature
```

Now you can modify existing files and commit the changes to this new branch. This tees up for the next section, `Pull Request`.

### Push/Pull Changes to GitHub

Once you modify the files in your new branch, you can stage & commit the changes and push them to the remote fork on GitHub.

``` bash
# stage all the changes
git add .

# commit them
git commit -m "updated content with new feature"

# push to remote repo on GitHub
git push
```

Output:

``` text
Enumerating objects: 6, done.
Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
Delta compression using up to 6 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 328 bytes | 328.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 4 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To https://github.com/PacketAnglers/avd-workshop.git
   07f3bd2..71765fe  main -> main
```

You should now see these changes and commit messages in GitHub.

![Git Commit](assets/images/git_commit.png){: style="width:800px"}

### Pull Request

A Pull Request in Git allows a contributor (you) to ask a maintainer (owner) of origin repository to review code changes they want to merge into a project. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Once all changes have been agreed upon, the maintainer of the original repo will merge your changes into the `main` branch. At this point, your code changes are live and visible in the origin project repo.

#### Steps to initiate a Pull Request

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
3. Above the list of files, click the Contribute drop-down and click Open pull request.
![PR](assets/images/git_pullrequest.png){: style="width:800px"}
4. Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
![PR Info](assets/images/git_pullrequest_info.png){: style="width:800px"}
5. Type a title and description for your pull request.
6. To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request. To create a draft pull request, use the drop-down and select Create Draft Pull Request, then click Draft Pull Request.

This will generate a Pull Request on the main project repository. The owner/maintainer can then merge the pull request once all changes are satisfied.
