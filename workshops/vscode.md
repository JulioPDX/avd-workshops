## What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code (VS Code), written by Microsoft, is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET).

VS Code integrates directly with Git and allows Network Engineers to easily perform the following tasks:

- Update Data Model Files in YAML
- Visually Compare File Diffs
- Write & Test Scripts
- Execute various Git commands (such as: status, init, log, commit, switch, add, etc...)
- Connect to Remote Hosts

VS Code is the Git Genie that makes your life easy.  Once you learn to use VS Code, you will wonder why it took so long to get on the bandwagon.
